/**
 * One-shot backfill of the calendar_events index for every source
 * model that uses HasCalendarEvents at the time this migration runs.
 * Walks the sources, chunks the rows, and force-syncs each so their
 * declared date columns land as calendar_events rows.
 *
 * On a fresh install the source tables are usually empty at this
 * point (this migration runs early), so the backfill is a no-op and
 * the observer takes over from there. On an upgrade from an install
 * that already has maintenances / audits / etc., the backfill
 * populates the index so those existing records show up on the
 * calendar without waiting for a manual save on each one.
 *
 * Capped at the most-recent 2000 rows per source (ordered by primary
 * key desc). Large installs with a decade of audit / maintenance /
 * checkout history would otherwise grind through every historical
 * row during upgrade to populate a calendar view most users only use
 * for recent and upcoming events. Admins who want the full backlog
 * run snipeit:reconcile-calendar-events after the upgrade completes.
 *
 * Duplicates snipeit:reconcile-calendar-events's sync logic on
 * purpose - the command is meant to be re-runnable on demand later,
 * this migration is the one-time seed at deploy time. Kept small
 * enough that no shared helper class is needed between them.
