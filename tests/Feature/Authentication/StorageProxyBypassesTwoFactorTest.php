 * is enabled. Those image fetches must NOT be intercepted by
 * CheckForTwoFactor — otherwise the browser sees broken images AND
 * the middleware's setIntendedUrl() call clobbers the real intended
 * URL with a storage-proxy path, causing post-2FA redirects to land
 * on a logo URL instead of the dashboard. See issue #19457.
