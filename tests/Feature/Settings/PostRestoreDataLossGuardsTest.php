/**
 * Regression coverage for the Christopher Finks / Issue 1 restore data-loss
 * bug. Before the fix, SettingsController::postRestore called Artisan::call
 * ('db:wipe') before verifying the archive or taking a pre-restore backup,
 * so an invalid/corrupt/foreign archive destroyed the pre-existing database
 * while the flow still reported success.
 *
 * These tests exercise the two guards the fix added:
 *
 * 1. The archive is validated with ZipArchive::open() BEFORE db:wipe runs.
 *    A malformed zip therefore leaves the current database untouched.
 * 2. A pre-restore backup is taken BEFORE db:wipe runs. If snipeit:backup
 *    fails, restore aborts before touching the database.
