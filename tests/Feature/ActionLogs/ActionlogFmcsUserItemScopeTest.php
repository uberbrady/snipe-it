/**
 * Regression coverage for GHSA-mch3-g6rh-gj22.
 *
 * User-item action_logs (item_type = App\Models\User) land with
 * company_id = NULL because the users table has no scalar company_id
 * column (users belong to companies via the company_user pivot). Before
 * the fix, CompanyableScope treated ALL null-company action_logs as
 * globally visible, on the assumption that null-company meant "global
 * config record" (AssetModel, Manufacturer, Category, Statuslabel,
 * etc.). That assumption was wrong for User-item rows, which carry PII
 * in their log_meta diff (email, phone, employee_num, notes, address,
 * jobtitle, ...) written by UserObserver on every profile edit.
 *
 * Result: any FMCS-scoped user with reports.view (or the more granular
 * users.view for a specific target) could read the entire activity
 * trail of every user in every other company on the install.
 *
 * Fix (Company::scopeCompanyablesDirectly): null-company action_logs
 * are now split by item_type.
 *
 *   - Non-User items keep the existing "null is safe" rule. Global
 *     config action_logs (Category create/edit, Manufacturer create,
 *     etc.) remain cross-company visible as they were.
 *   - User-item rows require the viewer to share at least one company
 *     with the target user via the company_user pivot, matching the
 *     same visibility rule the users list itself applies under FMCS.
